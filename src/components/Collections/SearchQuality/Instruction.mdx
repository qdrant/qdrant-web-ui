### Example Output: 
`
[18/10/2024, 01:51:38] Point ID 1(1/100) precision@10: 0.8 
(search time exact: 30ms, regular: 5ms)
`

### Explanation

This output provides a comparison between:
- **Exact Search** (full kNN) 
- **Approximate Search** (using ANN - Approximate Nearest Neighbor)

**precision@10: 0.8**  
- Out of the top 10 results returned by the exact search, 8 were also found in the ANN search.

**Search Time Comparison**  
- Exact search: 30ms  
- ANN search: 5ms (faster but with minor accuracy loss)

### Tuning the HNSW Algorithm (Advanced Mode)

- **"hnsw_ef" parameter**: Controls how many neighbors to consider during a search.  
  - Increasing **hnsw_ef** improves precision but may slow down the search.

---

### Practical Use

The ANN search (with HNSW) is significantly faster (5ms vs. 30ms) but may have slight accuracy trade-offs.  
**Tip**: Adjust **hnsw_ef** in advanced mode to balance speed and accuracy.

### Additional Tuning Parameters (set in collection configuration)

1. **"m" Parameter**  
   - Defines the number of edges per node in the graph.  
   - A higher **m** value improves accuracy but increases memory usage.

2. **"ef_construct" Parameter**  
   - Sets the number of neighbors considered during index creation.  
   - Higher values increase precision but lengthen indexing time.
