# Full Text Filtering

Here's a step-by-step tutorial on **Full Text Filtering in Qdrant** using a collection of planetary data with description fields:

## Step 1: Create a collection

We first create a collection named `star_charts` with vectors of size 4 and dot product distance for similarity.

```json withRunButton="true"
PUT /collections/star_charts
{
  "vectors": {
    "size": 4,
    "distance": "Dot"
  }
}
```

## Step 2: Add data with descriptions in payload

Next, we add data to the collection. Each entry includes an id, vector and a payload containing details about various celestial bodies, such as colony information, whether the body supports life and a description.

```json withRunButton="true"
PUT collections/star_charts/points
{
  "points": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "vector": [0.05, 0.61, 0.76, 0.74],
      "payload": {
        "colony": "Mars",
        "supports_life": true,
        "description": "The red planet, Mars, has a cold desert climate and may have once had conditions suitable for life."
      }
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "vector": [0.19, 0.81, 0.75, 0.11],
      "payload": {
        "colony": "Jupiter",
        "supports_life": false,
        "description": "Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system, known for its Great Red Spot and hostile gas environment."
      }
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "vector": [0.36, 0.55, 0.47, 0.94],
      "payload": {
        "colony": "Venus",
        "supports_life": false,
        "description": "Venus, Earth’s twin in size, has an extremely thick atmosphere and surface temperatures hot enough to melt lead."
      }
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "vector": [0.18, 0.01, 0.85, 0.80],
      "payload": {
        "colony": "Moon",
        "supports_life": true,
        "description": "Earth’s Moon, long visited by astronauts, is a barren, airless world but could host colonies in its underground caves."
      }
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "vector": [0.24, 0.18, 0.22, 0.44],
      "payload": {
        "colony": "Pluto",
        "supports_life": false,
        "description": "Once considered the ninth planet, Pluto is a small icy world at the edge of the solar system."
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Step 3: Try filtering with exact phrase (substring match)

Now, let's try to filter the descriptions to find entries that contain the exact phrase "host colonies." 
Qdrant supports text filtering by default using exact matches, but note that this will not tokenize the text.

```json withRunButton="true"
POST /collections/star_charts/points/scroll
{
  "filter": {
    "must": [
      {
        "key": "description",
        "match": {
          "text": "host colonies"
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  "limit": 2,
  "with_payload": true
}
```

You’ll notice this filter works, but if you change the phrase slightly, it won’t return results, since substring matching in unindexed text isn’t flexible enough for variations.

**Note**: If your cluster is running on Qdrant Cloud, this query fails. On Qdrant Cloud, collections are configured to run in strict mode by default, which prevents querying unindexed fields. You'll learn how to index a field for text filtering next.

### Step 4: Index the description field

To make filtering more powerful and flexible, we’ll index the `description` field. This will tokenize the text, allowing for more complex queries such as filtering for phrases like "cave colonies." We use a `word` tokenizer, and only tokens that are between 5 and 20 characters will be indexed.

**Note:** You should always index a field before filtering. If you use filtering before you create an index (like in Step 3), Qdrant will search through the entire dataset in an unstructured way. Your search performance will be very slow.

```json withRunButton="true"
PUT /collections/star_charts/index
{
    "field_name": "description",
    "field_schema": {
        "type": "text",
        "tokenizer": "word",
        "lowercase": true
    }
}
```

### Step 5: Try the filter again

After indexing, you can now run the filter again, but this time not searching for a phrase. 
Now you will filter for all tokens "caves" AND "colonies" from the descriptions. 

```json withRunButton="true"
POST /collections/star_charts/points/scroll
{
  "filter": {
    "must": [
      {
        "key": "description",
        "match": {
          "text": "caves colonies"
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  "limit": 2,
  "with_payload": true
}
```
## Summary

Full text filtering on an unindexed field performs a substring match by default, or results in an error on collections running in strict mode (the default on Qdrant Cloud). It's a best practice to index the field first. This enables more advanced full text queries, such as queries that ignore the word sequence completely.
