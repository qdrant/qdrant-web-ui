# Full Text Filtering

Here's a step-by-step tutorial on **Full Text Filtering in Qdrant** using a collection of planetary data with description fields:

## Step 1: Create a collection

We first create a collection named `star_charts` with vectors of size 4 and dot product distance for similarity.

```json withRunButton="true"
PUT /collections/star_charts
{
  "vectors": {
    "size": 4,
    "distance": "Dot"
  }
}
```

## Step 2: Add data with descriptions in payload

Next, we add data to the collection. Each entry includes a vector and a payload containing details about various celestial bodies, such as colony information, whether the body supports life, and a description.

```json withRunButton="true"
PUT collections/star_charts/points
{
  "points": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "vector": [0.05, 0.61, 0.76, 0.74],
      "payload": {
        "colony": "Mars",
        "supports_life": true,
        "description": "The red planet, Mars, has a cold desert climate and may have once had conditions suitable for life."
      }
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "vector": [0.19, 0.81, 0.75, 0.11],
      "payload": {
        "colony": "Jupiter",
        "supports_life": false,
        "description": "Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system, known for its Great Red Spot and hostile gas environment."
      }
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "vector": [0.36, 0.55, 0.47, 0.94],
      "payload": {
        "colony": "Venus",
        "supports_life": false,
        "description": "Venus, Earth’s twin in size, has an extremely thick atmosphere and surface temperatures hot enough to melt lead."
      }
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "vector": [0.18, 0.01, 0.85, 0.80],
      "payload": {
        "colony": "Moon",
        "supports_life": true,
        "description": "Earth’s Moon, long visited by astronauts, is a barren, airless world but could host colonies in its underground caves."
      }
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "vector": [0.24, 0.18, 0.22, 0.44],
      "payload": {
        "colony": "Pluto",
        "supports_life": false,
        "description": "Once considered the ninth planet, Pluto is a small icy world at the edge of the solar system."
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Step 3: Try filtering with exact phrase (substring match)

Now, let's try to filter the descriptions to find entries that contain the exact phrase "host colonies." Qdrant supports text filtering by default using exact matches, but note that this will not tokenize the text.

```json withRunButton="true"
POST /collections/star_charts/points/scroll
{
  "filter": {
    "must": [
      {
        "key": "description",
        "match": {
          "text": "host colonies"
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  "limit": 2,
  "with_payload": true
}
```

You’ll notice this filter works, but if you change the phrase slightly, it won’t return results, since substring matching in unindexed text isn’t flexible enough for variations.

### Step 4: Index the description field

To make filtering more powerful and flexible, we’ll index the `description` field. This will tokenize the text, allowing for more complex queries such as filtering for phrases like "cave colonies." We use a `word` tokenizer, and only tokens that are between 5 and 20 characters will be indexed.

```json withRunButton="true"
PUT /collections/star_charts/index
{
    "field_name": "description",
    "field_schema": {
        "type": "text",
        "tokenizer": "word",
        "min_token_len": 5,
        "max_token_len": 20,
        "lowercase": true
    }
}
```

### Step 5: Try the filter again

After indexing, you can now run the filter again, this time searching for "cave colonies" in the descriptions. This query should now return results.

```json withRunButton="true"
POST /collections/star_charts/points/scroll
{
  "filter": {
    "must": [
      {
        "key": "description",
        "match": {
          "text": "cave colonies"
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  "limit": 2,
  "with_payload": true
}
```
