# Load Data into a Collection from a Remote Snapshot

In this tutorial, we will guide you through loading data into a Qdrant collection from a remote snapshot.

## Step 1: Import a snapshot to a collection

To start, create the collection `midjourney` and load vector data into it.
The collection will take on the parameters of the snapshot, with vector size of 512, and similarity measured using the Cosine distance.

```json withRunButton=true
PUT /collections/midjourney/snapshots/recover
{
  "location": "http://snapshots.qdrant.io/midlib.snapshot"
}
```

Wait a few moments while the vectors from the snapshot are added to the `midjourney` collection.

## Step 2: Verify the data upload

After the data has been imported, it's important to verify that it has been successfully uploaded. You can do this by checking the number of vectors (or points) in the collection.

Run the following request to get the vector count:

```json withRunButton=true
POST /collections/midjourney/points/count
```

The collection should contain 5,417 data points. 

### Step 3: Open the collection UI
You can also [inspect your collection](/dashboard#/collections/midjourney/) to review the uploaded data.
