In this tutorial, you will create a collection, load data into it and run a basic search query.

## Create a collection

First, create a collection to store vector data. Let’s name it `test_collection`. This collection will use the dot product distance metric to determine similarity between vectors. Added vectors will have 4 dimensions.

```json withRunButton=true
PUT collections/test_collection
{
  "vectors": {
    "size": 4,
    "distance": "Dot"
  }
}
```

## Add vectors

Now, you need to add a few vectors. For each vector, you will specify a JSON payload. A payload is metadata that describes each vector, such as `city`.

```json withRunButton=true
PUT collections/test_collection/points
{
  "points": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "vector": [0.05, 0.61, 0.76, 0.74],
      "payload": {"city": "Berlin"}
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "vector": [0.19, 0.81, 0.75, 0.11],
      "payload": {"city": "London"}
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "vector": [0.36, 0.55, 0.47, 0.94],
      "payload": {"city": "Moscow"}
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "vector": [0.18, 0.01, 0.85, 0.80],
      "payload": {"city": "New York"}
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "vector": [0.24, 0.18, 0.22, 0.44],
      "payload": {"city": "Beijing"}
    },
    {
      "id": 6,
      "vector": [0.35, 0.08, 0.11, 0.44],
      "payload": {"city": "Mumbai"}
    }
  ]
}
```

## Run a query

We need to ask a question in vector form: 

*Which of our stored vectors are most similar to the query vector ?* 

`[0.2, 0.1, 0.9, 0.7]`

```json withRunButton=true
POST collections/test_collection/points/search
{
  "vector": [0.2, 0.1, 0.9, 0.7],
  "limit": 3,
  "with_payload": true
}
```

Qdrant will go through all available data and return results in order of decreasing similarity. Note that payload and vector data is missing in these results by default.
See [payload and vector in the result](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/concepts/search#payload-and-vector-in-the-result) on how to enable it.

## Add a filter

You can narrow down the results further by setting conditions on the payload. Let's filter the closest results that include the city of "London".

```json withRunButton=true
POST collections/test_collection/points/search
{
  "vector": [0.2, 0.1, 0.9, 0.7],
  "filter": {
    "must": [
      {
       "key": "city",
       "match": { "value": "London" }
      }
    ]
  },
  "limit": 3,
  "with_payload": true
}
```

That’s it! You have just performed a vector search. You loaded vectors into a database and queried the database with your own vector. Qdrant found the closest results and presented you with a similarity score.
