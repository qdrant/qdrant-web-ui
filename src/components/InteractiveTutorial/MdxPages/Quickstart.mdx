In this short example, you will create a Collection, load data into it and run a basic search query.

<Alert severity="info">Click **RUN** button at code blocks to see a result of the query in the right part of the screen.<br/>Click inside a code block to edit it.</Alert>

## Create a collection

You will be storing all of your vector data in a Qdrant collection. Let's call it `test_collection`. This collection will be using a dot product distance metric to compare vectors.

```json withRunButton=true
PUT collections/test_collection
{
  "vectors": {
    "size": 4,
    "distance": "Dot"
  }
}
```

## Add vectors

Let's now add a few vectors with a payload. Payloads are other data you want to associate with the vector:

```json withRunButton=true
PUT collections/test_collection/points
{
  "points": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "vector": [0.05, 0.61, 0.76, 0.74],
      "payload": {"city": "Berlin"}
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "vector": [0.19, 0.81, 0.75, 0.11],
      "payload": {"city": "London"}
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "vector": [0.36, 0.55, 0.47, 0.94],
      "payload": {"city": "Moscow"}
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "vector": [0.18, 0.01, 0.85, 0.80],
      "payload": {"city": "New York"}
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "vector": [0.24, 0.18, 0.22, 0.44],
      "payload": {"city": "Beijing"}
    },
    {
      "id": 6,
      "vector": [0.35, 0.08, 0.11, 0.44],
      "payload": {"city": "Mumbai"}
    }
  ]
}
```

## Run a query

Let's ask a basic question - Which of our stored vectors are most similar to the query vector `[0.2, 0.1, 0.9, 0.7]`?

```json withRunButton=true
POST collections/test_collection/points/search
{
  "vector": [0.2, 0.1, 0.9, 0.7],
  "limit": 3
}
```

The results are returned in decreasing similarity order. Note that payload and vector data is missing in these results by default.
See [payload and vector in the result](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/concepts/search#payload-and-vector-in-the-result) on how to enable it.

## Add a filter

We can narrow down the results further by filtering by payload. Let's find the closest results that include "London".

```json withRunButton=true
POST collections/test_collection/points/search
{
  "vector": [0.2, 0.1, 0.9, 0.7],
  "filter": {
    "must": [
      {
       "key": "city",
       "match": { "value": "London" }
      }
    ]
  },
  "limit": 3
}
```

You have just conducted vector search. You loaded vectors into a database and queried the database with a vector of your own. Qdrant found the closest results and presented you with a similarity score.

## Next steps

Now you know how Qdrant works. Getting started with [Qdrant Cloud](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/cloud/quickstart-cloud/) is just as easy. [Create an account](https://qdrant.to/cloud) and use our SaaS completely free. We will take care of infrastructure maintenance and software updates.

To move onto some more complex examples of vector search, read our [Tutorials](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/tutorials/) and create your own app with the help of our [Examples](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/examples/).

**Note:** There is another way of running Qdrant locally. If you are a Python developer, we recommend that you try Local Mode in [Qdrant Client](https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant-client), as it only takes a few moments to get setup.
