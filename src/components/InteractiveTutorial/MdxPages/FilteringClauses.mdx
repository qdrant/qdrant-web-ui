Qdrant lets you to filter collections by combining **conditions** and **clauses**. In this tutorial, you will learn how to filter collections using filtering clauses.

Clauses are different logical operations, such as OR, AND, and NOT.
You can nest them inside each other to create any boolean expression.

Start by creating a new collection and adding vectors.

## Setup

Before we start to practice with filtering conditions, let's create some datapoints to work with.

  <summary>Run these two steps:</summary>

1. Create a collection:

``` json withRunButton="true"
PUT /collections/demo
{
  "vectors": {
    "size": 4,
    "distance": "Cosine"
  }
}
```

2. Add vectors:

``` json withRunButton="true"
PUT /collections/demo/points
{
  "points": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "vector": [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4],
      "payload": { "city": "London", "color": "green" }
    }, {
      "id": 2,
      "vector": [0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5],
      "payload": { "city": "London", "color": "red" }
    }, {
      "id": 3,
      "vector": [0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6],
      "payload": { "city": "London", "color": "blue" }
    }, {
      "id": 4,
      "vector": [0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7],
      "payload": { "city": "Berlin", "color": "red" }
    }, {
      "id": 5,
      "vector": [0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8],
      "payload": { "city": "Moscow", "color": "green" }
    }, {
      "id": 6,
      "vector": [0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9],
      "payload": { "city": "Moscow", "color": "blue" }
    }
  ]
}
```
</details>

**Note:** Take a good look at each point's `payload` field. You will need to add a filter using this payload.

## Must

When using `must`, the clause becomes `true` only if every condition listed inside `must` is satisfied.
In this sense, `must` is equivalent to the operator `AND`.

Run the next example:

``` json withRunButton="true"
POST /collections/demo/points/scroll
{
  "filter": {
    "must": [
      {
        "key": "city",
        "match": { "value": "London" }
      }, {
        "key": "color",
        "match": { "value": "red" }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Should

When using `should`, the clause becomes `true` if at least one condition listed inside `should` is satisfied.
In this sense, `should` is equivalent to the operator `OR`.

Example:

``` json withRunButton="true"
POST /collections/demo/points/scroll
{
  "filter": {
    "should": [
      {
        "key": "city",
        "match": { "value": "London" }
      }, {
        "key": "color",
        "match": { "value": "red" }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Must Not

When using `must_not`, the clause becomes `true` if none if the conditions listed inside `should` is satisfied.
In this sense, `must_not` is equivalent to the expression `(NOT A) AND (NOT B) AND (NOT C)`.

Example:

``` json withRunButton="true"
POST /collections/demo/points/scroll
{
  "filter": {
    "must_not": [
      {
        "key": "city",
        "match": { "value": "London" }
      }, {
        "key": "color",
        "match": { "value": "red" }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Combination

You can also use join different clauses:

``` json withRunButton="true"
POST /collections/demo/points/scroll
{
  "filter": {
    "must": [
      {
        "key": "city",
        "match": { "value": "London" }
      }
    ],
    "must_not": [
      {
        "key": "color",
        "match": { "value": "red" }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

In this case, the conditions are combined by `AND`.

Also, the conditions could be recursively nested. Example:

``` json withRunButton="true"
POST /collections/demo/points/scroll
{
  "filter": {
    "must_not": [
      {
        "must": [
          {
            "key": "city",
            "match": { "value": "London" }
          }, {
            "key": "color",
            "match": { "value": "red" }
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
