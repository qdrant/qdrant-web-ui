# Separate User Data in Multitenant Setups

In this tutorial, we will cover how to implement multitenancy in Qdrant. Multitenancy allows you to host multiple tenants or clients within a single instance of Qdrant, ensuring data isolation and access control between tenants. This feature is essential for use cases where you need to serve different clients while maintaining separation of their data.

## Step 1: Create a collection

Imagine you are running a recommendation service where different departments (tenants) store their data in Qdrant. By using **payload-based multitenancy**, you can keep all tenantsâ€™ data in a single collection but filter the data based on a unique tenant identifier.

Run the following request to create a shared collection for all tenants:

```json withRunButton=true
PUT collections/central_library
{
  "vectors": {
    "size": 4,
    "distance": "Dot"
  }
}
```

## Step 2: Build a tenant index

Qdrant supports efficient indexing based on the tenant's identifier to optimize multitenant searches. By enabling tenant indexing, you can structure data on disk for faster tenant-specific searches, improving performance and reducing disk reads.

Run the following request to enable indexing for the tenant identifier (`group_id`):

```json withRunButton=true
PUT /collections/central_library/index
{
    "field_name": "group_id",
    "field_schema": {
        "type": "keyword",
        "is_tenant": true
    }
}
```

## Step 3: Load vectors for tenants

Next, you will load data into the shared collection. Each data point is tagged with a tenant-specific identifier in the payload. This identifier (`group_id`) ensures that tenants' data remains isolated even when stored in the same collection.

Run the following request to insert data points:

```json withRunButton=true
PUT /collections/central_library/points
{
  "points": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "vector": [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4],    
      "payload": {
        "group_id": "user_1",
        "station": "Communications",
        "message_log": "Contact with colony headquarters."
      }
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "vector": [0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8],
      "payload": {
        "group_id": "user_2",
        "station": "Security",
        "message_log": "Monitor intruder alert system."
      }
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "vector": [0.9, 1.0, 1.1, 1.2],
      "payload": {
        "group_id": "user_3",
        "station": "Engineering",
        "message_log": "Repair warp core malfunction."
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Step 4: Perform a filtered query

When querying the shared collection, use the `group_id` payload field to ensure tenants can only access their own data. The filter in this query ensures that only points belonging to the specified `group_id` are returned.

Run the following request to search for data specific to `user_1`:

```json withRunButton=true
POST /collections/central_library/points/query
{
    "query": [0.2, 0.1, 0.9, 0.7],
    "filter": {
        "must": [
            {
                "key": "group_id",
                "match": {
                    "value": "user_1"
                }
            }
        ]
    },
    "limit": 2,
    "with_payload": true
}
```

## Step 5: Add more data

If needed, you can add more data points for multiple tenants. This example shows how to expand the collection with new points tagged with different `group_id` values:

<details open={true}>
<summary>Add more data</summary>

```json withRunButton=true
PUT /collections/central_library/points
{
  "points": [
    {
      "id": 4,
      "vector": [0.89, 0.95, 1.03, 0.99],
      "payload": {
        "group_id": "user_4",
        "station": "Medical",
        "message_log": "Prepare medical supplies."
      }
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "vector": [0.82, 0.87, 0.83, 0.88],
      "payload": {
        "group_id": "user_5",
        "station": "Operations",
        "message_log": "Schedule maintenance for the day."
      }
    },
    {
      "id": 6,
      "vector": [0.91, 1.05, 0.96, 0.90],
      "payload": {
        "group_id": "user_1",
        "station": "Communications",
        "message_log": "Dispatch signal to rescue team."
      }
    },
    {
      "id": 7,
      "vector": [0.78, 0.86, 0.84, 0.81],
      "payload": {
        "group_id": "user_2",
        "station": "Security",
        "message_log": "Check perimeter for breaches."
      }
    },
    {
      "id": 8,
      "vector": [1.04, 0.97, 1.01, 0.93],
      "payload": {
        "group_id": "user_3",
        "station": "Engineering",
        "message_log": "Run diagnostics on the shield generator."
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
</details>

## Step 6: Group query results

You can group query results by specific fields, such as `group_id`, to get an overview of each tenant's data. This query groups results by `group_id` and limits the number of groups and the number of points per group.

Run the following request to group the results by `group_id`:

```json withRunButton=true
POST /collections/central_library/points/query/groups
{
    "query": [0.01, 0.45, 0.6, 0.88],
    "group_by": "group_id",  
    "limit": 5,  
    "group_size": 5,
    "with_payload": true  
}
```
