# Hybrid Search with Sparse and Dense Vectors 

In this tutorial, we will continue to explore hybrid search in Qdrant, focusing on both sparse and dense vectors. 
This time, we will work with a collection related to `terraforming_plans`, and each data point will have a brief description of its content in the `payload`.

## Step 1: Create a collection with sparse vectors

We'll start by creating a collection named `terraforming_plans`. This collection will support both dense vectors for semantic similarity and sparse vectors for keyword-based search.

```json withRunButton=true
PUT /collections/terraforming_plans
{
    "vectors": {
        "size": 4,  
        "distance": "Cosine"  
    },
    "sparse_vectors": {
        "keywords": { }
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
- **`vectors`**: Configures the dense vector space with 4 dimensions, using cosine similarity for distance measurement.
- **`sparse_vectors`**: Configures the collection to support sparse vectors for keyword-based indexing.

## Step 2: Insert data points with descriptions

Now, we'll insert three data points into the `terraforming_plans` collection, each related to a different celestial body (Mars, Jupiter, and Venus). Each point will have both a dense and sparse vector, along with a `description` in the `payload`.

```json withRunButton=true
PUT /collections/terraforming_plans/points
{
    "points": [
        {
            "id": 1,  
            "vector": {
                "": [0.02, 0.4, 0.5, 0.9],   // Dense unnamed vector
                "keywords": {
                   "indices": [1, 42],    // Sparse for "rocky" and "Mars"
                   "values": [0.22, 0.8]  // Weights for these keywords
                }
            },
            "payload": {
                "description": "Plans about Mars colonization."
            }
        },
        {
            "id": 2,  
            "vector": {
                "": [0.3, 0.1, 0.6, 0.4],   
                "keywords": {
                   "indices": [2, 35],    // Sparse for "gas giant" and "icy"
                   "values": [0.15, 0.65]  // Weights for these keywords
                }
            },
            "payload": {
                "description": "Study on Jupiter gas composition."
            }
        },
        {
            "id": 3,  
            "vector": {
                "": [0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0.8],   
                "keywords": {
                   "indices": [10, 42],    // Sparse for "Venus" and "rocky"
                   "values": [0.3, 0.5]    // Weights for these keywords
                }
            },
            "payload": {
                "description": "Venus geological terrain analysis."
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Dense vector**: Represents the semantic features of the data point in a numerical form.
- **Sparse vector (`keywords`)**: Represents the keyword features, with `indices` mapped to specific keywords and `values` representing their relevance.
- **`payload`**: Provides a short description of the data point's content, making it easier to understand what each vector represents.

## Step 3: Perform a hybrid search

Next, perform a hybrid search on the `terraforming_plans` collection, combining both keyword-based (sparse) and semantic (dense) search using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF).

```json withRunButton=true
POST /collections/terraforming_plans/points/query
{
    "prefetch": [
        {
            "query": { 
                "indices": [1, 42],   
                "values": [0.22, 0.8]  
            },
            "using": "keywords",
            "limit": 20
        },
        {
            "query": [0.01, 0.45, 0.67, 0.89],
            "using": "",
            "limit": 20
        }
    ],
    "query": { "fusion": "rrf" },  // Reciprocal rank fusion
    "limit": 10,
    "with_payload": true
}
```

### Explanation:
- **`prefetch`**: Contains two subqueries:
  - **Keyword-based query**: Uses the sparse vector (keywords) to search by keyword relevance.
  - **Dense vector query**: Uses the dense vector for semantic similarity search.
- **`fusion: rrf`**: Combines the results from both queries using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF), giving priority to points ranked highly in both searches.
- **`limit`**: Limits the number of results to the top 10.

## Summary

In this tutorial, we:
1. Created a Qdrant collection called `terraforming_plans` that supports hybrid search using both dense and sparse vectors.
2. Inserted data points with both dense and sparse vectors, as well as descriptions in the payload.
3. Performed a hybrid search combining keyword relevance and dense vector similarity using Reciprocal Rank Fusion.

This approach allows for effective hybrid search, combining textual and semantic search capabilities, which can be highly useful in applications involving complex search requirements.
